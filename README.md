Hello Anime Fans!!

If you want to watch an anime but you are too busy to find one yourself, you are using the right app!

Here we have over 500 most up-to-date anime database. We will recomend you Animes based on the rating.
You also have access to 2 lists, My Watch List, and My Favorite List, or whatever you want to name them.

So, in the main menu, you can choose “Browse Top Anime” to see a top-rated-anime we recommend to you.
If you like the Anime we recommend, you can add that Anime to either, or both of the lists.
If you don’t like it, no worries, click “Keep Browsing” and we will show you another top rated one!
We won’t recommend you something you have already seen. Everything you see will be fresh!
So be careful, when you miss something, it is gone.

If you finish the anime we recommended, you can go to the “View/Edit My Lists” to delete that anime from your lists.

Whenever you are done, just exit the app. Everything will be saved automatically.

Upcoming: A new “Search Anime by Name” function will be available soon! You will be able to find the anime by its title, and you will see everything eles you want to know about that anime! And then, you will have the option to add it to your lists, or just simple search for another one. Every anime is searchable, even for ones you have missed by clicking “Keep Browsing”
